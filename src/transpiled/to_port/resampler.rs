  Logging features

  This file specifies ::aubio_log_set_function and

  logging functions to redirect warnings and errors from aubio to your
  application. The custom function should have the prototype defined in
  ::aubio_log_function_t.

  After a call to ::aubio_log_set_level_function, ::aubio_log_reset can be used
  to reset each logging functions to the default ones.
